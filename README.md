# Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence Bibliography

Welcome to my RCI bibliography repository. In the BibLaTeX file you find a constantly growing collection of references to books, articles, websites or similar sources that are somehow connected to RCI.

It's still in an early state! Contributions are appreciated!

## Contributions
If you want to add some references or fix some mistakes, feel free to send me a pull request on the DEV branch. Please **verify** the integrity of your entries by building the test document. 
Add a citation of a new entry in the test file and run latex. 
Tip: Use [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/) for simplified editing, additional integrity checks and easy cleanup.
